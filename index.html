            <p id="about-me-paragraph">I'm more than just a coder, I'm a sum of all of the experiences that I've gained from my past work. I'm excited to learn more and to bring new knowledge with me where ever I go. I love working with new people so that we can make a new project great. When I'm not working on a project you can normally find me biking or running new trails. And when the world isn't in the middle of a pandemic, I love to travel to new places and try incredible food.</p>
